📫 JQMail – Email Writer Application

JQMail is a personal project designed to give the userprovide a simple, fast email writing and reading experience. This application was built using JavaFX for the UI creation, Firebase for database storing, and CSS for the visual design. 
The application allows users:
- to create and sign into their account,
- log into their account
- write/send emails
- view emails
- draft emails


📘 Background

The idea for this project originated from one of my course back at Farmingdale State College (CSC - Adv Prog.) where we had to choose and design an aplication ofr a final a project and I chose to deisgn a Email Writing Application, initially named JMail. We had to apply all the concepts we learned in class into the project and while my original submission met the basic requirements, it had clear limitations in terms of optimization, visual design, and data management. These areas were where i wanted to improve upon as I developed my programming abilities.
